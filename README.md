# Garden Walk Real Estate
A Machine Learning that after broadly analyzing the housing data do predicts the future prices.
Here we first deeply analyze the data via different techniques. And deliberately in the data I remove some of the instaces from the attributes so that we can do our data science better.

## The Name
Here I've assume the project for a real estate company which is a fictional real estate business and we first analyze it's data and then after deeply analyzing at certain point, then after that we can actually predict the prices.

## The Model
The models we've used are based upon the reasons, which are described within the notebook's comments.
